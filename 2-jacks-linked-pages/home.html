	<h2>What should I do when I have no ideas?</h2>
	
	<p>I think I might have a Creative Block. It sounds much better than <span><strong>"It's Sunday and I am too lazy to do anything"</strong></span>. I will google "creative block" and will try to get the idea of what it is. <br>
	So here we go: 
	</p>
	<q><em>For a creative professional, a creative block isn't just frustrating - it's potentially 
	career-damaging. When you rely on your creativity to pay the bills and build your 
	reputation, you can't afford to be short of ideas or the energy to put them into action.</em></q>
	
	<p>Wow, sounds very serious. I really can't afford to be short of ideas.</p>
	
	<q><em>Sometimes a block comes from having too much, not too little.</em></q>
	
	<p>Hmmm...interesting. I always though that I have not enough and know
	it looks that I have too much. I definitely need to find a cure from this disease.</p>
	<p>It's good that I am not alone and my omniscient friend Google will not leave me here hanging with this scary block.</p>
